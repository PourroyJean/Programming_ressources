The purpose of this web system is two fold:
- it allows you to develop CUDA applications without the need to buy and/or setup a CUDA system
- it allows us to grade your submissions more efficiently, uniformly, and promptly.

This document describes the online system, walking through the pages that you will see, and describes a sample submission. 
The submission system is designed to support the entire development and submission cycle for all the lab assignments.
